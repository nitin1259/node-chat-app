idea would be to make chat rooms case insensitive.

Next up I'd like to make user names unique.

It would be cool to reject new users who also have the same name as an existing user.

Next up one idea that I was thinking about adding that would be pretty cool is to add a list of the

currently active chat rooms down below.

This could be a select dropdown.

It's going to repopulate.

Kind of like the People's list repopulate.

This is by far the hardest feature but I think it would be really cool.

That means I would see a drop down in between the join and the input box and it would have the two currently

active rooms.

Hello TR and EHLO TR with an uppercase are although hopefully if you implement that first feature we

would only see one room.

Then instead of typing in a room name I could just pick one from the dropdown type in a name and join

that way.

These are just a few ideas of how you can continue on with a chat app if you do end up adding any of

these.
